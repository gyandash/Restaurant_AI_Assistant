                "Search for restaurants based on user-provided criteria. Use any specific information the user mentions to find the best matches.

                Core Function:
                - Returns matching restaurants sorted by relevance
                - When specific criteria are mentioned, uses them to find the best matches
                - Without specific criteria, returns top 10 recommended restaurants
                - All searches return complete restaurant details including restaurant_id

                Valid Parameters:
                - name: Restaurant name as mentioned by user
                - location: Areas or landmarks user mentions (e.g., 'Koramangala', 'MG Road')
                - cuisine: Common cuisine types (Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, Asian, Continental, American)
                - operating_hours: Time in HH:MM format
                - operating_days: Days of operation
                - restaurant_max_seating_capacity: Total capacity (30-120) - useful when discussing venue size or large groups
                - max_booking_party_size: Group size limits (6-20) - relevant for booking discussions

                Usage Guidelines:
                1. Search Approach:
                - Use any specific details the user mentions
                - Perform focused searches with clear criteria
                - Only use empty search when user gives no specific preferences

                2. Parameter Best Practices:
                - Include all relevant details mentioned by user
                - Use terms as mentioned by user
                - When user mentions group size or capacity needs, use appropriate capacity parameters

                3. Capacity Context:
                - restaurant_max_seating_capacity helps find venues suitable for larger gatherings
                - max_booking_party_size helps match restaurants to specific group booking needs

                The function returns matching restaurants with all details needed for reservations."

                        Required Information:

                        Before Confirming:
                        1. Ensure you have all needed details from natural conversation
                        2. Handle all date/time conversions (tomorrow, next week, evening, etc.)
                        3. Verify party size works for the restaurant
                        4. Review complete booking details with customer

                        - Collect information naturally through conversation
                        - Convert dates and times internally without asking user for specific formats

                        - Never guess or assume any details
                        - Don't proceed if party size exceeds restaurant capacity"
